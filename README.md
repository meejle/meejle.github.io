# Pokémon Emerald Textbox Simulator

This is a laughably-simple web-based tool for [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) ROM hacks that allows you to experiment with text wrapping and sentence lengths in your browser, without having to rebuild your ROM every time.

Even if you&rsquo;re using [poryscript](https://github.com/huderlem/poryscript), this might save you some time rewriting your sentences to stop them wrapping onto too many lines.

> [!NOTE]
> This should work fine on all modern browsers but, for the best experience, use a desktop browser.
